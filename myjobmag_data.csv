"Junior Data Analyst / Developer, Nature for Water Facility at Nature Conservancy","The Junior Data Analyst / Developer will form a critical part of N4W’s Program Intelligence team, focusing on building and managing our data processing and analysis pipelines. These systems help N4W gather and make sense of diverse information from a range of on-the-ground partner programs (‘Partners’), and thereby produce relevant intelligence findings that support those Partners’ effectiveness and growth, as well as drive focus on where investments can maximize long-term conservation impact.
The position is full-time, fully remote, and can be based in any country where TNC is registered as a Non-government Organization and established employer in Latin America (Argentina, Belize, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru), the Caribbean (The Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands), and Africa (Angola, Gabon, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zambia). This role is offered as a fixed-term 24-month contract, with the opportunity to renew if both TNC and the successful candidate agree.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU
N4W’s Program Intelligence team is focused on understanding (1) what kind of impact we are helping drive on the ground, (2) what we are learning from individual Partners that can be mainstreamed across our N4W team, TNC and the broader water sector; and (3) where N4W and TNC should be strategically investing to maximize impact over the long term.
As a critical team member, the Junior Data Analyst / Developer’s primary responsibility will be to support the design, build-out, and management of Program Intelligence for N4W. The data and analysis contained within this system are key to the delivery of N4W project teams and the long-term success of on-the-ground Partners.
The key focus for this Junior Data Analyst / Developer role will be supporting the expansion and management of a central Program Intelligence system which uses Python and SQL code to ingest, store and process data within the Databricks platform, and then visualises outputs in Tableau and PowerBI. The functions and outputs of this Program Intelligence system are critical for several parties, such as Partners, funders, TNC leadership, and N4W scientists and economists. Many of these parties receive bespoke output tables or dashboard visualisations from the system, which the Junior Data Analyst / Developer will help build. For example, these include N4W’s ‘Impact Dashboard’, which is used to report to funders, and ‘Decision Support Systems’, which is used by Partners.
The Junior Data Analyst / Developer will also work closely with N4W colleagues who use tools such as ArcGIS, Matlab, KoboToolbox, and Microsoft Excel to provide key inputs to the Program Intelligence system. The Program Intelligence team includes one full-time senior developer, a team lead, N4W’s science technical director, and several other N4W colleagues who contribute to Program Intelligence with between 20-40% of their time.
Responsibilities for executing these key focus areas include:
[Back-end] Ensuring smooth alignment with, and integration of, data capture and storage systems, templates and procedures.
[Processing] Building and managing data processing pipelines, primarily using Python and SQL code within Databricks, to update and analyse data.
[Front-end] Owning the building and updating of visualization suites using PowerBI or similar software.
[Maintenance] Helping troubleshoot bugs across the entire Program Intelligence system, and adding or updating features for existing processes as required.
[Analytics] In the medium-term, e.g., beginning in 2026, performing additional bespoke analyses and/or developing tooling to drive project-level and programmatic insights, utilizing data that have been gathered and structured through the above steps.
This position may include domestic and/or international travel opportunities, including to remote field locations (anticipated travel burden of 5-10%).
