Job Description

There are two task areas: 1) Report development; 2) Report Maintenance
Report development involves the following:
Identifying required data and its relationships within the enterprise system.
Note: The enterprise system will usually be related to Oracle Federal Financials, Azure-based .net developed systems, or the EFI Pace production management system. These enterprise systems will either have an Oracle database or a SQL Server database backend.
Once the data is known, the process of establishing and synchronizing data feeds to the Synapse Data Lake will be coordinated with the enterprise service bus team. If the data already exists within the Data Lake, then adding the fields to the semantic model will be done in Power Bl.
Once the semantic model is available, report development can be coordinated iteratively with the business unit staff until it is accepted and pushed to production.
Ad hoc Development: Business Units can and will request specific reports to suit their business needs, whether for reporting to upper management or producing reports for auditors. These could be enhancements or modifications of a previously developed report, or they could be something entirely new. These requests could come at any time during the contract year.
New report development will be done in Power BI, a cloud-based offering with application and infrastructure support provided by Microsoft.
Support work is currently underway to establish additional reports in Power BI, continuing the efforts to move away from Business Objects.

Qualifications
General report development using Power BI (Azure Synapse).

Open Date
May 06, 2025
Description
BACKGROUND:
Climate change is here, and storms that feel extreme now will only become more frequent and more intense. Rebuild by Design’s research on federal disaster declarations due to extreme weather, documented in the Atlas of Disaster (2022) and theAtlas of Accountability (2025) finds that 95% of Americans and 99% of congressional districts have had a climate disaster since 2011. The analysis includes county-level data for where major disasters have occurred, where post-disaster federal assistance has been given, where the most socially vulnerable populations reside, the energy reliability by utility area, and where compounding physical and social risks indicate a potential high return on investment. The research is a blueprint for equitable planning, and better decision-making for government, the private sector, philanthropy, and finance. Rebuild utilizes this data to call for state-level Resilient Infrastructure Funding sources supported by a ballot measure or a small surcharge on insurance, as well as a number of federal disaster policy changes to ensure that communities, no matter where they live, will not suffer from increasingly severe climate events.

Part-time Data Analytics and Visualization Assistant/Assistant Research Scientist
Working under the Director of Rebuild by Design, this position will support the organization’s climate adaptation research, spatial data analysis, and policy-driven publications that inform local, state, and national decision-making. This is an ideal opportunity for a graduate student or recent Master’s graduate interested in applying technical data skills to equity-centered, policy-relevant work.
Data Analysis & Policy Research
Analyze climate impact data (e.g., FEMA declarations, sea level rise projections, floodplains) using R, Python, or Excel to identify trends and vulnerabilities across states and counties.
Aggregate and clean publicly available datasets (ACS, CDC SVI, NOAA, etc.) to support climate adaptation policy recommendations.
Identify and extract key metrics that support equity-focused adaptation policies and reform opportunities.
Conduct research on existing adaptation strategies and legislation at the state and local levels.
Support the translation of quantitative findings into compelling data stories for a variety of audiences.

Geospatial Analysis & Mapping
Perform GIS analysis including spatial joins, overlays, and intersect functions to assess vulnerability and infrastructure exposure.
Create static and interactive maps using QGIS, ArcGIS Pro, or Mapbox for inclusion in public reports, presentations, and web-based tools.
Assist in developing geospatial methodologies that quantify climate risk and social vulnerability at multiple scales.
Maintain and organize internal geospatial datasets and metadata documentation.

Visualization & Communication
Develop clear and engaging data visualizations (e.g., infographics, charts, Tableau dashboards) to accompany reports and advocacy materials.
Collaborate with policy and communications teams to ensure that visual outputs align with messaging goals and are accessible to non-technical audiences.
Assist with layout and formatting of reports using InDesign, Illustrator, or Google Workspace tools as needed.
This position will require approximately 15-20 hours per week. Scheduling is flexible in coordination with the Rebuild team. Tasks can be performed at either the Rebuild by Design office at New York University or remotely.

Additional Information: In compliance with NYC’s Pay Transparency Act, the compensation for this position is $40/Hourly USD. A New York University considers factors such as (but not limited to) scope and responsibilities of the position, candidate’s work experience, education/training, key skills, internal peer equity, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.

About Rebuild by Design
As the world faces rising populations, mass migration, climate change, social injustices, and economic challenges, communities can’t afford to wait until after the next crisis to plan for the future. Through regional competitions, local engagements, research and policy, Rebuild by Design is reimagining the way communities find solutions for today’s large-scale, complex problems by creating collaborations across communities and governments.

BI Engineer I,"Maybe you’re bored and need a new challenge. Or you’re tired of being the lone BI person stuck in a never-ending reporting cycle with no room to think strategically. Or maybe you just want to work somewhere that values storytelling with data as much as technical chops.
Whatever the reason, we want you to know that LT is different. And not just air quotes “different,” but more like “I actually look forward to Mondays again” different.
It’s a place where you can write your own story and make a difference along the way. At LT, you’ll have the freedom and flexibility to do what you think needs to be done, and you’ll get to do it while working alongside a team of other curious individuals who love a good challenge too.
We’re currently looking to add a Power BI Engineer I to this nerd club of ours. If you’re someone who has 1-3 years of experience turning messy data into meaningful insights, we’d love to chat.
Here’s what you can expect as a Power BI Engineer I at LT:
You’ll work closely with cross-functional teams—engineers, analysts, product managers, and clients—to design, build, and maintain Power BI dashboards that actually get used (and loved).
You’ll help clients define KPIs that matter and create visual stories that make those numbers actionable.
You’ll coach clients and teammates on Power BI best practices, modern data architecture, and why “more filters” isn’t always the answer.
You’ll push beyond basic reports to help automate insights, detect anomalies, and drive business strategy with data.
You’ll keep learning—because that’s who you are—and we’ll support you with the time, tools, and resources to grow in your career.","https://www.glassdoor.com/job-listing/bi-engineer-i-lean-techniques-JV_KO0,13_KE14,29.htm?jl=1009812828913"

Once the semantic model is available, report development can be coordinated iteratively with the business unit staff until it is accepted and pushed to production.
Ad hoc Development: Business Units can and will request specific reports to suit their business needs, whether for reporting to upper management or producing reports for auditors. These could be enhancements or modifications of a previously developed report, or they could be something entirely new. These requests could come at any time during the contract year.
New report development will be done in Power BI, a cloud-based offering with application and infrastructure support provided by Microsoft.
Support work is currently underway to establish additional reports in Power BI, continuing the efforts to move away from Business Objects.

Open Date
May 06, 2025
Description
BACKGROUND:
Climate change is here, and storms that feel extreme now will only become more frequent and more intense. Rebuild by Design’s research on federal disaster declarations due to extreme weather, documented in the Atlas of Disaster (2022) and theAtlas of Accountability (2025) finds that 95% of Americans and 99% of congressional districts have had a climate disaster since 2011. The analysis includes county-level data for where major disasters have occurred, where post-disaster federal assistance has been given, where the most socially vulnerable populations reside, the energy reliability by utility area, and where compounding physical and social risks indicate a potential high return on investment. The research is a blueprint for equitable planning, and better decision-making for government, the private sector, philanthropy, and finance. Rebuild utilizes this data to call for state-level Resilient Infrastructure Funding sources supported by a ballot measure or a small surcharge on insurance, as well as a number of federal disaster policy changes to ensure that communities, no matter where they live, will not suffer from increasingly severe climate events.

Part-time Data Analytics and Visualization Assistant/Assistant Research Scientist
Working under the Director of Rebuild by Design, this position will support the organization’s climate adaptation research, spatial data analysis, and policy-driven publications that inform local, state, and national decision-making. This is an ideal opportunity for a graduate student or recent Master’s graduate interested in applying technical data skills to equity-centered, policy-relevant work.
Data Analysis & Policy Research
Analyze climate impact data (e.g., FEMA declarations, sea level rise projections, floodplains) using R, Python, or Excel to identify trends and vulnerabilities across states and counties.
Aggregate and clean publicly available datasets (ACS, CDC SVI, NOAA, etc.) to support climate adaptation policy recommendations.
Identify and extract key metrics that support equity-focused adaptation policies and reform opportunities.
Conduct research on existing adaptation strategies and legislation at the state and local levels.
Support the translation of quantitative findings into compelling data stories for a variety of audiences.

Geospatial Analysis & Mapping
Perform GIS analysis including spatial joins, overlays, and intersect functions to assess vulnerability and infrastructure exposure.
Create static and interactive maps using QGIS, ArcGIS Pro, or Mapbox for inclusion in public reports, presentations, and web-based tools.
Assist in developing geospatial methodologies that quantify climate risk and social vulnerability at multiple scales.
Maintain and organize internal geospatial datasets and metadata documentation.

Visualization & Communication
Develop clear and engaging data visualizations (e.g., infographics, charts, Tableau dashboards) to accompany reports and advocacy materials.
Collaborate with policy and communications teams to ensure that visual outputs align with messaging goals and are accessible to non-technical audiences.
Assist with layout and formatting of reports using InDesign, Illustrator, or Google Workspace tools as needed.
This position will require approximately 15-20 hours per week. Scheduling is flexible in coordination with the Rebuild team. Tasks can be performed at either the Rebuild by Design office at New York University or remotely.

Additional Information: In compliance with NYC’s Pay Transparency Act, the compensation for this position is $40/Hourly USD. A New York University considers factors such as (but not limited to) scope and responsibilities of the position, candidate’s work experience, education/training, key skills, internal peer equity, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.

About Rebuild by Design
As the world faces rising populations, mass migration, climate change, social injustices, and economic challenges, communities can’t afford to wait until after the next crisis to plan for the future. Through regional competitions, local engagements, research and policy, Rebuild by Design is reimagining the way communities find solutions for today’s large-scale, complex problems by creating collaborations across communities and governments.
Rebuild convenes global expertise, with regional leadership, and community stakeholders to gain a better understanding of how overlapping environmental and human-made vulnerabilities leave communities at risk. Rebuild’s core belief is that through collaboration our communities can grow stronger and better prepared to stand up to whatever challenges tomorrow brings.
